### Eye blink detection using dlib and OpenCV
#### What is eye aspect ratio (EAR)?
From the last project - Detecting facial landmarks - we know that we can apply facial landmark detection to localize important regions of the face, including eyes, eyebrows, nose, ears, and mouth. This also implies that we can extract specific facial structures by knowing the indexes of the particular face parts. In terms of blink detection, we are only interested in two sets of facial structures â€” the eyes.

### How to run:
Download or clone this repository on your local device and run the following command in the terminal while being in the Eye-blink-detection folder -  `python detect_blinks.py`. If there's any package/module missing, you can easily install them using the `pip` command.
